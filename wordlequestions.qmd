## Part 1. Introduction to Bits 

Suppose a person was playing the daily wordle. However, today's a weird day because when NYT was selecting a word for the answer, they only randomly selected from these 10 possible words:

PLANE PLANT CRANE SHAPE SLANT FLARE PARTY GLINT GRAPH APPLE

For this scenario, let's assume this person doesn't know about this restriction in the answer choice. They decide to start the game by guessing STAMP.

1.  Let's say the actual answer was PLANE. What "result" would the guess STAMP give?

2.  With that "result," how many of those 10 possible words are eliminated from being the correct choice?

3.  Repeat 1-2, but let's say this person guessed MARCH.

4.  Repeat 1-2, but let's say this person guessed PLAIN.

5.  Repeat 1-2 but let's say this person guessed MYTHS

Working with probabilities is a bit funky.
